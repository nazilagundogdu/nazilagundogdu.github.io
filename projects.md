### Personal Projects
- **Ongoing** <br />
**[Movie Trends of the Past 1/2 Century:](https://github.com/nazilagundogdu/movie-trends)** This project, which is still ongoing, was inspired by my personal interests on the movie industry. Noticing a downword projectory of the movies' qualities, I was curious to see if I can (dis)prove this assumption. To do so, I have so far analyzed the Oscar-nominated movies in the past 50 years. I am planning to expand the analysis to more movies based on their genre, etc. 

  
### Selected Professional Projects (Amazon)
- **Ongoing** <br />
**[Generative AI on Alexa:](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-ai)** I have been involved with this movement on various levels and projects, starting from migrating existing features to the LLMs, to providing data for testing the model performance.  

  
- **Fall 2023** <br />
**Seamless Switching:** Customers are able to enable or disable their bluetooth connection with their echo buds via voice. I supervised the design and implementation of this feature, synchronizing with stakeholders and other relevant parties, overseeing an A/B experiment and keeping the project on track.

- **Fall 2022** <br />
**[Widgets Feature on Echo Show 15 and QLED Fire TV Devices:](https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-omni-qled-announced-specs-availability-174942741.html})** Widgets feature allows the customers to open their widget gallery and edit their favorite widget panel using their voice only. I was the main Language Engineer that designed, implemented and delivered the Natural Language Understanding part of this feature

- **Fall 2022** <br />
**[FindMy Project- Fire TV Remote:](https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/amazon-fire-tv-remotes-new-feature-lets-you-find-device-with-voice-commands/)** This feature allows customers to find their remotes using a voice command. I was one of the three main Language Engineers who worked on this feature. I was specifically involved in addressing some high severity issues, including root causing, debugging and fixing, that arose during the testing phase threatening the launch of this feature.

- **Winter 2021** <br />
**Share my ETA:** This feature allows customers to share their estimated arrival times with others. I was the Language Engineer that designed, implemented and delivered the Natural Language Understanding part of this feature.
  
### Term Projects

- **Fall 2020** <br />
**[A c-command Decoder:](https://github.com/nazilashafiei/NLP-Project)** This project was done as a team project (with Jing Ji) for the NLP (CSE538) course taken at Stony Brook University. The goal of the project is to build a model
that encodes c-command dependencies directly from strings rather than trees. The input for the model is parsed trees from Penn Treebank and the model was trained using Gated Recurrent Units and dense layers.
This is still an ongoing project since the model seems to be suffering from overfitting due to the small size of data resulting in sparsity. Moreover, 
the use of dense layer seems to be discarding sequential information.


- **Spring 2019**	<br />
**[Sentiment Analysis:](https://github.com/nazilashafiei/Sentiment-Analysis)**
This project was done as a term project for AMS561 course at Stony Brook Univesity. This was a joint work with two other classmates. 
Using Python scikit-learn machine learning package, we did a sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews on Kindle e-books.
